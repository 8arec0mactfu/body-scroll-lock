A Textbook of Engineering Physics is a valuable resource for engineering students who want to master the fundamentals of physics and apply them to their fields of study.

The book is divided into 15 chapters, each covering a specific topic of engineering physics. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts of units, dimensions, vectors, and scalars. The second chapter deals with the kinematics and dynamics of particles and rigid bodies. The third chapter explains the concepts of work, energy, and power. The fourth chapter covers the topics of elasticity, stress, strain, and Hooke's law.
 
The fifth chapter discusses the properties of matter, such as thermal expansion, calorimetry, specific heat, latent heat, and thermal conductivity. The sixth chapter covers the topics of thermodynamics, such as the laws of thermodynamics, Carnot cycle, entropy, and heat engines. The seventh chapter introduces the concepts of simple harmonic motion, waves, and sound. The eighth chapter explains the phenomena of reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, and polarization of light.
 
The ninth chapter covers the topics of crystal physics, such as crystal systems, Bravais lattices, Miller indices, X-ray diffraction, and crystal defects. The tenth chapter deals with the topics of acoustics and ultrasonics, such as reverberation, absorption coefficient, Sabine's formula, ultrasonic waves, and applications of ultrasonics. The eleventh chapter introduces the concepts of lasers, fiber optics, and holography. The twelfth chapter covers the topics of nanotechnology and nanomaterials.

The thirteenth chapter deals with the topics of quantum mechanics, such as the wave-particle duality, Schrodinger equation, uncertainty principle, and quantum numbers. The fourteenth chapter covers the topics of superconductivity and nuclear physics, such as the Meissner effect, BCS theory, types of superconductors, nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, and nuclear energy. The fifteenth chapter discusses the topics of modern physics, such as the special theory of relativity, mass-energy equivalence, photoelectric effect, Compton effect, and pair production.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with a focus on the applications of physics to engineering problems. The book is suitable for students of all branches of engineering who want to learn the basics of physics and enhance their analytical and problem-solving skills. The book is also useful for teachers and researchers who want to update their knowledge of engineering physics.
