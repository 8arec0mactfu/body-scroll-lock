Another feature that sets the Mio C230 apart from other entry-level GPS devices is the text-to-speech functionality.

In Navigate mode, you can enter your destination by address, point of interest, NavPix, coordinates, or history. You can also plan a multi-stop trip or avoid certain roads or areas. In Explore mode, you can view the map in 2D or 3D mode, zoom in and out, and get information about your current location and speed.
